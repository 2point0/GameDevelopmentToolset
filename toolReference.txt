Many of the tools follow the format of the original tools. Some of the normal FX tools are simply adjusted from the originals and have a camera rig ready for flipbook creation. Others are a bit more custom and need descriptions at this time. This document will be updated as I develop these tools further!
Rigid Body Dynamics: A series of tools pertaining to dynamics and destruction.
Fracture Rig
INPUTS: Packed Rigid Body Nodes from a DOP Network (one or multiple)
Requirements: Each geometry that’s referenced needs a primitive attribute called “name” in which each piece is [piece0, piece1, piece2, etc]. The attribute is automatically created via the Voronoi Fracture SOP.
Notes: Make sure the transforms are locked down or are kept to a minimum. It’s common for a minor transform modification to cause havoc with piece translates and rotations.
