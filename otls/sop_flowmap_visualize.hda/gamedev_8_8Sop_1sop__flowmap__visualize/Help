@parameters
    Diffuse Texture:
        Texture to preview flowmap, default is to use a texture embedded in the HDA.

    Speed:
        Speed of the flowmap animation.
    Distortion Amount:
        Amount of warping applied to the flowmap preview. Larger values create a more pronounced effect, but can introduce ghosting artifacts.

    Flowmap Texture:
