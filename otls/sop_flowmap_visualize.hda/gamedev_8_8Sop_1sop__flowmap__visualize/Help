""" Preview a flowmap in the Houdini viewport at high quality and high interactivity. """

[Image:opdef:.?flowmap_shader.gif]

If you’ve made a flowmap using the Gamedev flowmap tools, you can see a high quality realtime preview in Houdini’s viewport. 
Append a flowmap visualise, and use the parameters to control the speed and texture used.

@parameters
    Diffuse Texture:
        Path to the texture used for preview, defaults to an internal caustic jpg
    Diffuse Tiling:
        Number of times the texture is repeated in UV space
    Speed:
        Speed the flowmap is previewed at when playback is active.
    Distortion Amount:
        Strength of of the flowmap effect. Small values are better.
    Flowmap Mode:
        Choose if the flowmap is read from @Cd, or from a texture.
    Flowmap Texture:
        If the flowmap mode is texture, this parameter sets the texture path.
