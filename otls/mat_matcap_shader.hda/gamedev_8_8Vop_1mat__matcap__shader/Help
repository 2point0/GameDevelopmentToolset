""" Apply a 'matcap' image to geometry in the style of Zbrush and other apps, giving a wide variety of looks at realtime framerates. """



@parameters
    MatCap Texture:
        Texture to use as matcap, a photo or render of a sphere, cropped as tightly as pssible. The normals of the geometry will be matched with the implied normals of the sphere image, reading the pixel colour from the matching position.
    Use MatCap Alpha:
        If an alpha channel is in the texture, also map that into the shaded geometry.
