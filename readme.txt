Description: This is a series of tools geared towards assisting Houdini users with creating assets for game development. It started out primarily for effects, but has been slowly growing in other ways. Feel free to download, modify, and share these tools! My only request is to credit my name when appropriate. If you enjoy these tools and would like to do something for me, feel free to buy me a beer at GDC ;)

Instructions

Copy the contents of this folder (/toolbar) into the following folders depending on your operating system:

Windows
C:\Users\[username]\Documents\houdini[ver#]\toolbar

OSX
/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/houdini/[ver#]/toolbar

When you open Houdini, you'll need to add the shelf. If you look up at the current shelves, there should be a little triangle pointing downwards in the UI. Click that -> Shelf Sets -> RealTimeVFX and the shelf should pop up.

If you’d like to save its location, you’ll need to save the desktop via the Window menu.

Special Thanks:
Kyle Nikolich for collaborating on this!
Ryan Dowlingsoka for reminding me I need to be more Pythonic with my basic Python skills :P
